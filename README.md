# Cosmos Zone
Cosmos Zone is an independent blockchain that exists in Cosmos. Each zone has its own consensus, governance, and token economy. The concrete structure of the blockchain can also have its own form. Zones can communicate with hubs through IBC (Inter Blockchain Communication) and communicate with other zones via hubs. hupayx-hub is a zone in the Cosmos Chain, but it is aimed to link with various other payment and point system zones in the future, so it adopts the name hub.

## e-Wallet
- HUPAYX end-to-end mobile payment platform is comprised of 'SHUFFLE' Multi-Digital Currency Wallet on the customer side, where users can easily send, buy, store and most importantly pay in 'SHUFFLE' points (prepaid e-money), which is backed by local currency. Crypto users can import their digital assets, store them or do near-instantaneous P2P transactions between SHUFFLE wallet users for free. Most important function is that crypto users can finally utilize their assets in real life by converting crypto into points inside of the wallet and making purchases at 'VAULT' point-of-sale system supported merchants.
